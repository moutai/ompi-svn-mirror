[ibv_query_gid failed]
Open MPI failed to query the GID of a port on an OpenFabrics device.
This is unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the OpenFabrics configuration on this node.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the udverbs BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Local host:      %s
  Device:          %s

[ibv_query_device failed]
Open MPI failed to query an OpenFabrics device.  This is unusual and
shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be something wrong with
the OpenFabrics configuration on this node.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the udverbs BTL, which may result

[verbs_port_bw failed]
Open MPI failed to query the supported bandwidth of a port on an
OpenFabrics device.  This is unusual and shouldn't happen.  It
suggests that there may be something wrong with the OpenFabrics
configuration on this node.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the udverbs BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

#
[eager_limit too high]
The eager_limit in the udverbs BTL is too high for a device that Open
MPI tried to use.  The udverbs BTL eager_limit value is the largest
message payload that Open MPI will send in a single datagram.  

You are seeing this message because the eager_limit was set to a value
larger than the MPI message payload capacity of a single UD datagram.
The max payload size is smaller than the size of individual datagrams
because each datagram also contains MPI control metadata, meaning that
the some bytes in the datagram must be reserved for overhead.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the udverbs BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Local host:            %s

  Max payload allowed:   %d
  Specified eager_limit: %d
