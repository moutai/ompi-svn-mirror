[ibv_FOO failed]
Open MPI failed a basic verbs operation on a Cisco USNIC device.  This
is highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the USNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Server:          %s
  Device:          %s

  Description:     %s
#
[async event]
Open MPI detected a fatal error on a USNIC port.  Your MPI job will
now abort; sorry.

  Server:           %s
  Device:           %s
  Port:             %d
  Async event code: %s (%d)
#
[internal error]
An internal error has occurred in the Open MPI USNIC BTL.  This is
highly unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that there may be
something wrong with the USNIC or OpenFabrics configuration on this
server.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

  Device:          %s

  Description:     %s
#
[verbs_port_bw failed]
Open MPI failed to query the supported bandwidth of a port on a Cisco
USNIC device.  This is unusual and shouldn't happen.  It suggests that
there may be something wrong with the USNIC or OpenFabrics
configuration on this server.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.

#
[eager_limit too high]
The eager_limit in the usnic BTL is too high for a device that Open
MPI tried to use.  The usnic BTL eager_limit value is the largest
message payload that Open MPI will send in a single datagram.  

You are seeing this message because the eager_limit was set to a value
larger than the MPI message payload capacity of a single UD datagram.
The max payload size is smaller than the size of individual datagrams
because each datagram also contains MPI control metadata, meaning that
the some bytes in the datagram must be reserved for overhead.

Open MPI will skip this device/port in the usnic BTL, which may result
in either lower performance or your job aborting.
