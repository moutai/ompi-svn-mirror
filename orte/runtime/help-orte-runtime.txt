[orte_init:startup:internal-failure]
It looks like orte_init failed for some reason; your parallel process is
likely to abort.  There are many reasons that a parallel process can
fail during orte_init; some of which are due to configuration or
environment problems.  This failure appears to be an internal failure;
here's some additional information (which may only be relevant to an
Open MPI developer):

  %s failed
  --> Returned value %s (%d) instead of ORTE_SUCCESS
#
#
[orte:session:dir:prohibited]
The specified location for the temporary directories required by Open MPI
is on the list of prohibited locations:

Location given: %s
Prohibited locations: %s

If you believe this is in error, please contact your system administrator
to have the list of prohibited locations changed. Otherwise, please identify
a different location to be used (use -h to see the cmd line option), or
simply let the system pick a default location.
#
[orte:session:dir:nopwname]
Open MPI was unable to obtain the username in order to
create a path for its required temporary directories. This
is usually caused by either the UID being removed from the
passed file, or from use of network-based authentication
service (e.g., NIS) on a large cluster that might suffer
from congestion.

Please consult your system administrator about these
conditions and try again.
#
[orte_nidmap:too_many_nodes]
An error occurred while trying to pack the information about the job. More nodes
have been found than the %d expected. Please check your configuration files such
as the mapping.
