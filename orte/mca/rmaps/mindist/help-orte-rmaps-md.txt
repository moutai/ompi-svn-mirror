[multi-apps-and-zero-np]
Open MPI found multiple applications to be launched, and at least one
that failed to specify the number of processes to execute.  When
specifying multiple applications, you must specify how many processes
of each to launch via the -np argument.
#
[orte-rmaps-mindist:no-pci-locality-info]
No PCI locality information could be found on at least one node:

  Node: %s

Open MPI therefore cannot map the application as specified.
