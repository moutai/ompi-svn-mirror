Files oshmem.spec and buildrpm.sh provide a way to create binary and source rpms of the OSHMEM.
In order to create rpms:
./buildrpm.sh
Created rpms are located in ./rpm-dest/.

Several parameters are hardcoded in the buildshmem.sh: package name, version, release. Apart fromit, one can specify wheter to create source rpm or not.
See comments in buildrpm.sh.

Binary rpms created by the script are relocatable, implying that they can be installed in user specified directory with:
sudo rpm -ihv --prefix=<USER DIR> <RPM>

Default params:
package_name=openshmem
version=1.1
release=1
_prefix=/opt/<package_name=openshmem> - place to install


In order to create binary tarball from binary rpm:
./buildtarball.sh <rpm>
The output will appear in ./tarballs/
